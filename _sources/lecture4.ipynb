The bank charges interest at a rate of $R \\%$ per year, and each year you pay $s$ pounds to the bank. How long does it take to pay off your mortgage, as a function of $M, R$, and $s$ ? Writing $r=R / 100$, find the numerical value of this time when $M=200,000$, $s=10,000$, and $r=0.02$. Are there any values of $M, R$, and $s$ for which you will never pay off your mortgage?\n",
