    "We can generalise this to $U(t+\\tau)=f_{\\tau}[U(t)]$ for some constant time $\\tau$. However, in practice, you can always choose your units so that $\\tau=1$. For example, foxes breed once per year, so it makes sense to use one year as your unit of time. However, some species of albatross breed only once every two years. In this case you could set $\\tau=2$ and have 'one year' as your unit of time. But instead you may choose to have 'two years' as your unit of time and then we can stick with $\\tau=1$. With this in mind, we say that 'without loss of generality' we can set $\\tau=1$, and thus use Equation (4) as our definition of a difference equation.\n",

We call $r$ the net reproduction rate when we are modelling population growth. However, Equation (5) can be used to model anything whose growth over time is proportional to its value. For example, we can use it to model the growth of someone's student loan debt over time once the have finished University. Here, $U(t)$ is the value of the debt and $r$ is the interest rate.\n",

    "We can use the result of Proposition (1) to calculate the number of rabbits in $N$ years time for any $N$. For example, assuming $r=1$, in 20 years time there will be $10 \\times 2^{20}$ rabbits, which is more than ten million. In 30 years there will be more than ten billion. As it happens, these numbers are not far off what really happened in Austrtalia during the late 1800s and early 1900s. However, if we keep going, in 270 years, there will be more rabbits on the island than atoms in the known universe, which is both a flat contradiction and terrifying. The moral of the story is, unless we are only concerned with short times, we will need a better model.\n",

    "So what is missing in our current model? Well, it currently does not account for the fact that rabbits must eat in order to survive and reproduce, and there is only a finite amount of vegetation on the island.

    "Perhaps the best way to find out how a difference equation will behave over time is to find an exact analytic solution, but this is not always possible.
