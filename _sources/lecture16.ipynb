    "# Lecture 16. Relative motion \n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lecture, we looked at the motion of particles relative to a fixed origin, which we denoted by $O$. However, in reality objects will often be moving relative to one another. For example, you may be running in the park and about to reach a junction of footpaths, but see a cyclist coming along another path towards the same junction. Your motion relative to the cyclist determines whether one of you needs to change speed to avoid a collision. Similar situations happen at sea with boats moving along overlapping trajectories. In this lecture, we will develop the tools for modelling such situations. Let's start with an example.\n",

    "```{prf:example}\n",
    "At time $t=0$ a boat leaves a port situated at the origin $O$ and moves with uniform velocity $u \\mathbf{i} \\mathrm{kmh}^{-1}$. (Here, $\\mathrm{kmh}^{-1}$ stands for 'kilometres per hour', the number of kilometres the boat will travel in an hour at its current speed.) A second boat is moving with uniform velocity $5 \\mathbf{i}+4 \\mathbf{j} \\mathrm{kmh}^{-1}$ and is initially at the point in the ocean with location vector $6 \\mathbf{i}-2 \\mathbf{j} \\mathrm{km}$ with respect to the origin, $O$.\n",
