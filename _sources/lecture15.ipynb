    "\n",
    "So far, we have only looked at particles that move in one dimension. However, given that space has (at least) three spatial dimensions, this is very limiting in terms of what we can model about the physical world. To extend the ideas from previous lectures into higher dimensions, we need vectors, which you have been studying in your Core module. For example, suppose there is a particle $P$ moving in 3 dimensions, as in Figure 21. Then its location at time $t$ is given by a vector, which we call $\\mathbf{r}(t)$. (Note that we use bold font for vectors.) As $t$ changes, $P$ traces out a curve, called the path of the particle.\n",
