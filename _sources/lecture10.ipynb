    "# Lecture 10. From the second law of motion to second order ODEs \n",
    "\n",
    "While he might not have describe dhimself as such, Isaac Newton was a fantastic mathematical modeller. One of his crowning achievements was describing the laws of motion, in particular the second law, which says that the force on an object is equal to its mass times its acceleration, $F=m a$. This turns out to be an extremely accurate mathematical model. It breaks down if your objects are extremely small (e.g. the size of a small molecule or less) or extremely massive (e.g. the mass of a star or bigger) but is remarkably good away from those extremes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the force may be a function of its location, $x$, and/or its speed, $s$. For example, the friction force of air on a falling object increased as its speed, $s$. As another example, the force of Earth's gravity decreases as an object's location, $x$, moves away from Earth. So we can write $F$ as a function of $x$ and $s$, i.e. $F=F(x, s)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, speed is just the rate of change in an object's location over time, so $s=\\dot{x}$. Also, acceleration is the rate of change in speed over time, so $a=\\dot{s}=\\ddot{x}$ (two dots over a symbol mean 'differentiate it twice with respect to time'). Putting this all together, we can write the second law of motion as\n",

    "Consider a mass $m$ on one end of a spring in a gravity-free environment (e.g. space), assuming that there is no friction. The other end is fixed. If we stretch the spring a distance $L$ and release it at time $t=0$, it has a single force acting on it, due to the tension of the spring, which we will call $T$. Hooke's law says that $T=k x$ where $k$ is the stiffness of the spring and $x$ is the extension of the spring. We can thus use the second law of motion (Equation 106) to show that\n",

    "(The reason for the minus sign is that the force is in the opposite direction to the extension, see Figure 15. The constant $\\omega$ will turn out to be the angular frequency of the oscillations, as we will see in the solution.) Find an expression for the extension, $x(t)$, as a function of time. Interpret the result physically, in terms of the movement of the mass, $m$.\n",

    "**Solution.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The ODE can be written $\\ddot{x}+\\omega^{2} x=0$, where $\\omega$ is a constant. To solve such an ODE, we use something called an ansatz. That's a German word meaning, essentially, 'an educated guess that will be verified later'. The ansatz we use here is that $x=A \\cos (m t)$ for constants $m$ and $A \\neq 0$. Then $\\dot{x}=-m A \\sin (m t)$ and $\\ddot{x}=-m^{2} A \\cos (m t)$. Placing these expressions into the ODE $\\ddot{x}=-\\omega^{2} x$ gives\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we need to apply the initial condition. Notice that the question said 'we stretch the spring to a distance $L$ and release it at time $t=0$ '. This means that the extension at time $t=0$ is $L$, i.e. $x(0)=L$. Hence, by Equation (108), $L=x(0)=A \\cos (0)=A$. Thus the solution is $x(t)=L \\cos (\\omega t)$.\n",
    "```\n",
    "The physical interpretation is that the mass oscillates in perpetuity between $x=-L$ and $x=L$ with angular frequency $\\omega$. The angular frequency is related to the period, $T$, of the oscillation via $\\omega=2 \\pi / T$. You may recall the definition of period from Section 3 as the smallest $T>0$ such that $x(t)=x(t+T)$ for all $t$.\n",
