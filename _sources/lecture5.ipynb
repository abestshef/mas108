First, we were not able to find an exact analytic solution to the discrete logistic model (see Lecture 3), but we can for the continuous logistic model (Equation 62). Second, the behaviour of the discrete solution can get pretty wild (again, see Lecture 3), including solutions that never settle, period doubling, and chaos. In contrast, the continuous logistic model always tends towards a constant, positive, steady state, $K$ in a monotonic fashion (e.g. Figure 8).\n",

In your model choice, you should be informed by the underlying reality.

If the former, then a continuous-time formalism may be better (i.e. differential equations); if the latter, then use discrete-time equations (i.e. difference equations).\n",
