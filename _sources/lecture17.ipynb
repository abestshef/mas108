    "# Lecture 17. Modelling the effect of gravity close to the Earth's surface \n",
    "\n",
    "Gravity is a fundamental aspect of life on Earth. Almost all the motion we experience on a day-to-day basis is influenced by the effect of gravity. That is why it seems so weird and wonderful to see astronauts hovering in space capsules away from (most of) the effects of gravity, or bouncing on the Moon where the gravity is much lower than on Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, being able to model the effect of gravity is a foundational aspect of our understanding of how the physical world works. There are still many unsolved problems related to understanding gravity out in the cosmos, where there are exotic objects like black holes, some of which are currently being explored by SoMaS staff. However, the effect of gravity close to the Earth's surface is something humankind has known how to model with great accuracy for a very long time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture we will derive the equations that govern motion under gravity close to the Earth's surface. (These are sometimes known as the 'suvat' equations, for reasons that will become clear soon.) Then, in the next few lectures, we will show how to put these into practice in a variety of applications.\n",

    "### 17.1 Motion under constant acceleration\n",
    "\n",
    "The key aspect of gravity near the Earth's surface that eases the modelling process is that it is pretty-well constant, at about $g \\approx 9.8 \\mathrm{~ms}^{-2}$. It is therefore useful to begin by generalising to any situation where acceleration is constant. So suppose an object is moving subject to a constant acceleration, $\\mathbf{a}$, where $\\mathbf{a}$ is a vector of arbitrary dimension. Denote its location at time $t$ by $\\mathbf{r}(t)$ and its velocity by $\\mathbf{v}(t)$.\n",
