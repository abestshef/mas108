    "# Lecture 18. Modelling projectile motion \n",
    "\n",
    "Last lecture we focused predominantly on models of motion in one dimension with constant acceleration, with a particular emphasis on acceleration due to gravity. This is fine for modelling things that move vertically up and down, but often movement occurs in a horizontal direction, too. Here we will examine motion under the effect of constant acceleration where there are components of motion both parallel and perpendicular to the direction of the acceleration.\n",
    "\n",
    "A paradigmatic example of this is the motion of projectiles close to the Earth's surface. When an object is propelled in a non-vertical direction, its motion will be governed by the acceleration due to gravity. However, the object will also have some horizontal movement.\n",

    "If we are modelling a projectile that has a non-vertical initial velocity, we can write the initial velocity as\n",
