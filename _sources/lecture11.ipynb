    "# Lecture 11. Modelling damped oscillations with homogeneous second order ODEs \n",
    "\n",
    "In Example 15, we examined a spring in a gravity-free, friction-free environment. Whilst gravity-free environments exist, it is never possible to have an environment completely free of friction. Even if we are in space, there will be some friction due to the spring itself. But also, by accounting for friction, we can bring our example down to Earth (quite literally). This lecture will explore what happens when we account for friction, as an example of modelling with homogeneous second order ODEs.\n",
