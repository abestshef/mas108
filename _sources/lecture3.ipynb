    "If you did Exercise 3 from Lecture 2 for your homework, you will have seen some interesting patterns emerge from the logistic model. This lecture, we are going to study the wealth of such patterns and learn how to categorise them. We will work with a version of the logistic map where $K=1$. You can thus think of $U(t)$ as being given in units of thousands of organisms (or millions of organisms) so that $K=1$ means that the carrying capacity of the environment is a thousand (or a million) organisms. We will also talk about an 'organism' rather than a 'rabbit' in this lecture, since there is nothing mathematically special about rabbits (just that they are fluffy and cute and breed a lot). This also gives you the chance to picture your favourite animal, plant, archaea, or whatever, as your study organism.\n",

    "Very often in modelling, when we start dealing with real numerics, the calculations can quickly become a bit of a handful. We therefore regulary start plugging numbers into some sort of numerical software to make the calculations easier. There are different levels of difficulty for achieving this, from simply repeatedly plugging numbers into a calculator, to using a spreadsheet like Excel with formulae in, to using programming languages like Python or R. While my predecessor on this course provided Excel spreadsheets - probably familiar to more of you and so in a sense more accessible - I have chosen to provide you with Python code. Much of what I provide will be set-up so that all you have to do is click some buttons, but since programming is an increasingly central pillar of mathematical modelling, I think it is useful for you to get used to looking at some code.\n",

At $t=4$, however, $U(t)$ overshoots the carrying capacity, as $U(4)=1.04$. It then decreases in the next step, to $U(5)=0.98$. It then goes back up, but to a smaller value of $U(6)=1.01$, and we see these oscillations gradually die down so that the solution reaches a steady state. Figure 6a shows this solution up to $t=50$, and there we can see the solutions settling down quite clearly to $U(t)=1$.\n",

So we will stop our analysis of Equation (15) here, just to say that if you are interested, search for 'period doubling route to\n",

    "\n",
    "Before we finish, though, we should go back to the original scientific question, which was about predicting the change in size of a population of organisms. The answer depends upon $r$. For small $r$, e.g. $r=1$, the population will grow monotonically, approaching a steady state as $t \\rightarrow \\infty$. For slightly larger $r$, e.g. $r=1.5$, the population grows initially, before oscillating around the steady state. However, these oscillations dampen over time and the population settles to steady state (Figure 6a). If $r$ is larger still, e.g. $r=2.2$ or $r=2.5$, the population size never settles but will oscillate in perpetuity in a predictive fashion (Figure 6b,c). If $r$ becomes even larger, there are no longer clear oscillations, but just a 'chaotic' jumping between different values. If we are in such a situation in real life, it becomes incredible hard both to fit data to the model and to predict the future.\n",
