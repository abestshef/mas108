    "Many larger, sexually-reproducing animals disperse as adolescents to find a new place to live. This is probably an evolved tactic to make it less likely for individuals to mate with those they are closely related to (that's why humans disperse to different universities as teenagers, right?).\n",
    "\n",
    "A dispersing animal will want to find the 'best place' to live on the landscape, which may mean the place with the most access to the resources it needs, or away from danger, or a combination thereof. Suppose we can quantify the 'quality' of the landscape (as perceived by the animal) as a function $G(x)$, where $x$ is space. Here we are assume (for simplicity despite lack of realism) that the landscape is one dimensional. Then a simple model of animal movement might assume that the change in location over time is equal to the gradient of $G(x)$ (Figure 9), so define $g(x)=\\frac{\\mathrm{d} G}{\\mathrm{~d} x}$.\n",

    "*Figure 9: Panel (a) shows an example landscape whose quality (for a dispersing animal) is given by a function $G(x)$. If the animal is at a place where the gradient of $G(x)$ is positive, such as the rabbit on the left-hand side at $x \\approx 30$, the animal will move to the right. On the other hand, if the gradient of $G(x)$ is negative, such as at $x \\approx 75$, the animal will move left. Panel (b) shows $g(x)$, the gradient of $G(x)$. The left-hand arrow shows the point where the left-hand rabbit from Panel (a) resides. Note that the value of $g(x)$ is positive here. The right-hand arrow shows the point where the right-hand rabbit from Panel (a) resides, where $g(x)$ is negative.*\n",

Furthermore, $g(x)$ could be way more complicated than a simple sine wave.

This has since been observed in a wide variety of contexts, and is named the Allee effect after the author of the goldfish study. The Allee effect may emerge simply because it is too hard to find a suitable mate when the population density is low (not enough fish in the sea, literally). Otherwise, it could be due a complex social structure being required for bringing up young who themselves are able to reproduce.
