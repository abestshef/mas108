    "We want to draw arrows on the $(U, t)$-plane describing the direction of change of the solution. But the direction of change is simply the gradient of the derivative, $\\dot{U}$, and we have a formula for that in Equation (104). With this in mind, the general technique for plotting a direction field is as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select a point $(t, U)$.\n",
    "2. At this point $(t, U)$, draw a short vector with gradient $\\dot{U}$.\n",
    "3. Repeat this process for multiple values of $t$ and $U$ to map out the flow in $(t, U)$ space.\n",
    "4. By following the directions of the arrows, the solution curves of the ODE can be determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "It helps to start by drawing a table of values of $\\dot{U}$ for a variety of pairs of values of $(t, U)$. An example is shown in Table 8 (Excel can help you construct this). Then, for each cell in this table, plot an arrow whose gradient is given by the value in the cell and whose location is given by the corresponding value of $U$ and $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 13 gives the result of this procedure (red arrows), where we have plotted a slightly wider range of values that that shown in Table 8. For example, if we look at the point on the graph where $t=\\pi$ and $U=0.5$, we find an arrow with gradient 0.75 , highlighted in red in Table 8.\n",

    "Values of $\\dot{U}$ for various $0 \\leq U \\leq 2$ and $0 \\leq t \\leq 3$ are given in Table 9. The resulting direction field is shown in Figure 14. If we start at any initial location $U(0)$, we see that the trajectory seems to be tending to 0 , so the animals die out. This is because the carrying capacity is $\\exp (-t)$, which tends to zero over time, i.e. the size of population that the environment can sustain decreases to zero over time.\n",
