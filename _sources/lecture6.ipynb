    "# Lecture 6. First order linear ordinary differential equations \n",
    "\n",
    "Last lecture, you saw an exact technique for solving separable ordinary differential equations. In this lecture, we are going to look at some techniques for solving what are called 'first order linear ordinary differential equations'. That's a lot of adjectives, many of which may be new! So we will start by giving some definitions.\n",
